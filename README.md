# Introduction
Hex is a strategic two-player game that offers a captivating blend of simplicity and depth. Originally invented by Piet Hein in 1942 and later it was rediscovered by John Nash at Princeton in 1948.Hex is played on a hexagonal board, where two players take turns placing their coloured tiles in an attempt to form a connected path from one side of the board to the other. Despite its straightforward rules, Hex presents players with complex strategic decisions, making every move critical to achieving victory.
# Objective of The Game
* The main objective of the game is to create an unbroken path connecting the two opposite sides of the board.
* One player aims to connect the top and bottom sides, while the other player aims to connect the left and right sides.
# Rules To Play The game
* Each player picks a color (e.g., red or blue) for their counters.
* Players alternate placing one counter on any empty hexagon per turn.
* Counters may not be moved except with the swap rule.
* The first player to form a connected path of their counters linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colour wins.
